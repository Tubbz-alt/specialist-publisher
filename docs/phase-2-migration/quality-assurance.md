## Quality assurance

As mentioned in the [Automated tests](./automated-tests.md) section, we
introduced a QA process to plug the holes in testing journeys through the
application. We started by asking a product manager to go through the old
Specialist Publisher application and to write down all of the "critical
journeys" they could find. We then worked with them to consolidate this into a
QA worksheet that has evolved over time.

You can see that worksheet
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IJcCsYp5mc3vAe27ZZu0Y0RddEVVxhrUlALneb56T_M/edit#gid=218945063).

We make it a mandatory step that when going live with a new format, at least two
people must run through this QA process. Later, we extended this invitation to
people outside the team to help with this burden. I would not recommend this
process to other teams looking to migrate. I think it would be better to look at
[RFC 50](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GOVUK/RFC+50%3A+do+end-to-end+testing+of+GOV.UK+applications) and try to solve that, instead.
