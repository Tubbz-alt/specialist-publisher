RSpec.describe AttachmentReporter do
  let(:document) { double(:document, body: <<-HTML, attachments: attachments) }
    # Testing #{described_class}

    This body uses inline attachmments:
      [InlineAttachment:foo.pdf]

    Some of the attachments are referenced more than once:
      [InlineAttachment:bar.pdf]
      [InlineAttachment:bar.pdf]
      [InlineAttachment:baz.pdf]
      [InlineAttachment:baz.pdf]
      [InlineAttachment:baz.pdf]

    This one is used, but is missing from the document:
      [InlineAttachment:missing.pdf]
      [InlineAttachment:missing.pdf]

    There's another on the document (unused.pdf) that we're not going to use.

  let(:attachments) { [
    double(:attachment, snippet: "[InlineAttachment:foo.pdf]"),
    double(:attachment, snippet: "[InlineAttachment:bar.pdf]"),
    double(:attachment, snippet: "[InlineAttachment:baz.pdf]"),
    double(:attachment, snippet: "[InlineAttachment:unused.pdf]"),
  ] }

  let(:report) { described_class.report(document) }

  it "builds a report of attachments, with respect to the document's body" do
    expect(report).to eq(

        unmatched: 2,
